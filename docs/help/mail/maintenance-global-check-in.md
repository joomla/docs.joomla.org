<!-- Filename: Help4.x:Maintenance:_Global_Check-in / Display title: Maintenance: Global Check-in -->

## Description

Allows Administrators to perform a global check-in of all currently
pending or locked items. It then shows the results of the Global
Check-in. This is useful, for example, if an Article is locked by a User
who opened it for editing and never finished the editing session. In
this case, other Users are not able to edit this Article. Performing a
Global Check-in releases all such items.

## How to access

- Select **System **→** Maintenance Panel **→** Global Check-in** from
  the Administrator menu.
