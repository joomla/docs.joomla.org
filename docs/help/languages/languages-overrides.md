## Description

Overrides allow you to change a core Joomla string.

In the Joomla code, text strings that are to appear in the User
Interface, either the Site interface or the Administrator interface, are
expressed as string constants. For example, the string *Your session has
expired. Please log in again.* is expressed as
*JLIB_ENVIRONMENT_SESSION_EXPIRED*. The text string can be translated
into any language. The default language is British English. There are
thousands of such strings in a Joomla installation.

If a string does not suit your site you can use the Language Override
feature to replace the original.

## How to Access

- Select **System **→** Manage Panel **→** Language Overrides**
