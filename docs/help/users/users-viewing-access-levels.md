## Column Headers

In the table containing the Access Levels from your Joomla! site, you
will see different columns. Here you can read what they mean and what is
displayed in that column.

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.

<!-- -->

- **Ordering:** (default). The column in which to sort displayed items
  in the table. The values are the same as the column heading names.
- **Level Name**. The name of the access level.
- **User Groups Having Viewing Access**. The groups that have viewing
  access.

<!-- -->

- **ID**. This is a unique identification number for this item assigned
  automatically by Joomla. It is used to identify the item internally,
  and you cannot change this number. When creating a new item, this
  field displays "0" until you save the new entry, at which point a new
  ID is assigned to it.

## List Filters

At the top you will see the filter bar shown in the Screenshot above.
The functions are:

- **Search**. Enter part of the level's name and press the Search icon
  to find matching names. Press 'Clear' to clear the search field and
  restore the list of levels.

## Toolbar

At the top of the page you will see the toolbar shown in the
[Screenshot](#Screenshot) above. The functions are:

- **New**. Opens the editing screen to create a new access level.

<!-- -->

- **Edit**. Opens the editing screen for the selected access level. If
  more than one access level is selected (where applicable), only the
  first access level will be opened. The editing screen can also be
  opened by clicking on the Name of the access level.

<!-- -->

- **Delete:** Deletes the selected access levels. Works with one or
  multiple access levels selected. Note that you cannot delete an access
  level that is currently being used. If you try to delete an access
  level that is assigned, a message showing where it is assigned will be
  displayed.

<!-- -->

- **Options.** Opens the Options window where settings such as default
  parameters can be edited.

<!-- -->

- **Help**. Opens this help screen.

## Quick Tips
