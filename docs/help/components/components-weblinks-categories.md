## Column Headers

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.

<!-- -->

- **Ordering.** You can change the order of an item within a list as
  follows:
  - If the list Filter Options include a Position filter select the
    desired Position. This will limit the list to items that are
    assigned to that Position.
  - Select the Ordering icon <img

    height="23" alt="Help30-Ordering-colheader-icon.png" /> in the Table
    heading to make it the active ordering item. The ordering icons in
    each row will change from light grey to dark grey and the pointer
    will change to a drag arrow on hover.
  - Select one of the Ordering icons <img

    height="21" alt="Help30-Ordering-colheader-grab-bar-icon.png" /> and
    drag it up or down to change the position of that row in the list.
    The items will display in the new order within the Position.

- **Language**. Item language.

<!-- -->

- **ID**. This is a unique identification number for this item assigned
  automatically by Joomla. It is used to identify the item internally,
  and you cannot change this number. When creating a new item, this
  field displays "0" until you save the new entry, at which point a new
  ID is assigned to it.

## List Filters

**Search bar**. Near the top of the page you will see the search bar
shown in the Screenshot above.

- **Search by Text**. Enter part of the search term and click the Search
  icon. *Hover* to see a *Tooltip* indicating which fields will be
  searched. To 'Search by ID' enter "id:x", where "x" is the ID number
  (for example, "id:19").
- **Filter Options**. Click to display the additional filters.
- **Clear**. Click to clear the Filter field and restore the list to its
  unfiltered state.
- **Ordering**. Shows the current list ordering field. 2 ways to change
  the order:
  - Select from the dropdown list. Ordering may be in ascending or
    descending order.
  - Click a column heading. The column heading toggles between ascending
    and descending order.
- **Number to Display**. Shows the number of categories in a list.
  Select from the dropdown list to change the number displayed. The
  default for a site is 20 set in the Global Configuration.

### Filter Options

The selections may be combined. Only items matching all selections will
be displayed in the list.

- **Select Status.** Use the drop-down list box to select the published
  state: Published, Unpublished, Trashed, or All. For Articles, you may
  also select Archived. **Important:** With the default setting of
  -Select Status-, the screen only shows Published and Unpublished
  items. If you have the filter set to -Select Status- and you change
  items to Trashed, the Trashed items will disappear from the screen.
  However, they have not been permanently deleted. To do that you need
  to:

1.  Change the filter to Trashed. The Delete icon will now show in the
    toolbar.
2.  Select the items you want to permanently delete.
3.  Click on the Delete icon.

You can see all items, regardless of their published state, by selecting
All for this filter. You can also re-publish Trashed items by selecting
them and clicking on the Publish icon in the toolbar.

  levels.
