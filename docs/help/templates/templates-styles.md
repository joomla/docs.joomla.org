## Column Headers

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.

- **Ordering.** You can change the order of an item within a list as
  follows:
  - If the list Filter Options include a Position filter select the
    desired Position. This will limit the list to items that are
    assigned to that Position.
  - Select the Ordering icon <img

    height="23" alt="Help30-Ordering-colheader-icon.png" /> in the Table
    heading to make it the active ordering item. The ordering icons in
    each row will change from light grey to dark grey and the pointer
