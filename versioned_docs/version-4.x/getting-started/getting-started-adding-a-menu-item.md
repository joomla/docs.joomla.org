<!-- Filename: J4.x:Getting_Started:_Adding_a_Menu_Item / Display title: Getting Started: Adding a Menu Item -->

## Introduction

Suppose one of your articles is sufficiently important for it to merit a
menu item - a link to it from the Main Menu. That would be a Single
Article menu item type. There are several ways to create a new menu
item:

- In the Administrator menu, expand the Menus item and select the **+**
  icon beside the Main Menu item.
- Select **Main Menu** in the Administrator menu and then select the
  **New** button in the Toolbar.
- Select **All Menu Items** in the Administrator menu and then select
  the **New** button in the Toolbar. If you use this route you also need
  to select the Menu the new item will appear in.

## The Menu Edit Page

The Menus: New Item form has four compulsory fields to complete:

- **Menu Title.** Enter a meaningful word or short phrase that will fit
  nicely into the Main Menu box.
- **Menu Item Type.** Select from a two-part list: a modal dialog offers
  a **Menu Item Type** list; open the Articles list and select the
  Single Article type at the bottom of the list.
- **Select Article.** Another modal dialog with a list of Articles on
  your site. Find and select the article this menu item will link to.
- **Menu.** Over on the right (or below on small screens) check that a
  menu is selected.

That is all that must be done. Everything else is optional. Save & Close
the using the Toolbar button and have a look at the Site Home page. The
menu item in the Main menu links directly to that page.

## Multiple Menu Items

So far so good. But what happens when you have 10 or 100 or 1000 or more
articles? It is time to think of other ways of managing articles and
other page layouts.
