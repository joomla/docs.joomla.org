Joomla!  4.0 <span id="main-portal-heading">**Tutorial**  
Adding a New Article</span>

## Introduction

This tutorial is part of a series about working with Joomla! Articles.

It covers the methods for adding a new article after logging in to the
Administrator Dashboard and is based on a standard Joomla installation
using the default content editor.

For more information on the different editors available in Joomla read:
[Content
Editors](https://docs.joomla.org/Content_creators#Content_Editors "Special:MyLanguage/Content creators").

Before starting, in addition to the content, if you use them, you will
need to know what category and any tags you will assign to the article.

- Log in to the Administrator Home Dashboard. More on this here:
  [Logging in or out of the Administrator
  Dashboard](https://docs.joomla.org/J4.x:Logging_in_to_Joomla "Special:MyLanguage/J4.x:Logging in to Joomla").

## Getting Started

### Directly from the Home Dashboard

data-file-width="1000" data-file-height="254" width="800" height="203"

Dependant on if your Home Dashboard has been customised after
installation, you will have one or two options to generate a new
article:

1.  In the Sidebar Menu click the **Content** link, then from the
    dropdown menu click the **plus (+) symbol** to the right of the
    Articles link.
2.  If it is displayed, in the Home Dashboard Site Panel click the
    **plus (+) symbol** to the right of the Articles icon.

### Via the Article Manager

<img

class="thumbborder" decoding="async"
srcset="https://docs.joomla.org/images/2/24/J4x_home_dashboard_add_article_en.png 1.5x"
data-file-width="1000" data-file-height="147" width="800" height="118"
alt="J4x home dashboard add article en.png" />

Either of these options will open up a page: **Articles: New** that is
ready for input.

## Preparing the Article

data-file-width="1000" data-file-height="341" width="800" height="273"
alt="J4x add article basic en.png" />

When a new article is generated it will open a tabbed panel with the
**Content** tab selected. It is possible to save a new article with only
two pieces of required information:

1.  Enter a title in the *Title* field. This is used where ever the
    article title is displayed. (**Required**) The *Alias* field next to
    the title field is not a required field as if it is left blank
    Joomla will create the alias when the article is saved. The alias is
    used to refer to the article and is important for the [Search Engine
    Friendly Address
    features](https://docs.joomla.org/Search_Engine_Friendly_URLs "Special:MyLanguage/Search Engine Friendly URLs").
    The alias may also be used by other site functionality such as
    plugins and modules to find the article.
2.  Choose a **Category**. See Article Settings below for more
    information.
3.  Whilst not strictly required to add and save an article, enter your
    content using the editor.

### Article Parameters

The other tabs above the content editor include several options or
parameters for the article. **You may not see all the following tabs**
as a Site Administrator may hide some to help maintain the consistency
of article layout across the website. You may also see additional tabs
for *Custom Fields* if they have been set up.

1.  *Images and Links* allows you to set an intro and featured image and
    / or links to appear in predefined positions. This may be used if
    your article will be displayed within a category blog.
2.  *Options* allows you to specify the layout of the article and
    associated information such as title, category, tags, publishing
    details etc. This is normally set globally but can be article
    specific through these options.
3.  *Publishing* allows you to set publishing dates and times to
    schedule publishing of an article. By default, when an article is
    saved it will be published straight away. You can also set the
    Metadata for the article.
4.  *Configure Edit Screen* allows you to show or hide parameters for
    the article.
5.  *Permissions* shows the permissions for each user group that control
    what can or cannot be done.

### Article Settings

Besides the content, an article has settings to manage publishing, how /
where it will be displayed and who can see it when published. In many
cases some of these will be left at their default setting:

<img
src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/thumb/b/bc/J4x_add_article_info_right_en.png/300px-J4x_add_article_info_right_en.png"
class="thumbborder" decoding="async"

data-file-width="392" data-file-height="629" width="300" height="481"
alt="J4x add article info right en.png" />

1.  Select the **Status**: Published, Unpublished, Archived, or
    Trashed - the default is *Published*.
2.  Select a **Category** using the drop down menu - this is a
    **Required** field. Note that although required, if you do not set
    it the article will still save but be set to the Joomla default
    category *uncategorised*. You can add a new category in this field
    by typing it in and **pressing enter**.
3.  Toggle the **Featured** setting on off, whether or not to display
    the article on the home page.
4.  Select the **Access** level for the article: Public, Registered,
    Super Users, etc.
5.  Select one or more **Tags** for your article. Start typing to find
    and select pre-defined tags or you can add a new one by typing it in
    and **pressing enter**.
6.  You can add a **Note** which will be visible in the Article Manager.
7.  You are also able to add a **Version Note** which will show in the
    version history for the article.

## Saving the Article

Once you have added the required information and content you can save
the article.

There are a number of ways to do this depending on what you wish to do
next in Joomla.

To save the article you can choose to *Save*, *Save&Close*, *Save to
Menu* or Save&New as follows:

<img
src="https://docs.joomla.org/images/thumb/1/1b/J4x_add_article_saving_en.png/300px-J4x_add_article_saving_en.png"
class="thumbborder" decoding="async"
srcset="https://docs.joomla.org/images/thumb/1/1b/J4x_add_article_saving_en.png/450px-J4x_add_article_saving_en.png 1.5x, https://docs.joomla.org/images/1/1b/J4x_add_article_saving_en.png 2x"
data-file-width="500" data-file-height="234" width="300" height="140"
alt="J4x add article saving en.png" />

1.  Click the **Save** toolbar button to save your changes. This will
    keep the article open. It is good practice to regularly save your
    work on longer articles.
2.  Click the **Save & Close** toolbar button to save the article and
    take you to the Articles List. The Save & Close button has a further
    two drop-down options:
    1.  Click the **Save to Menu** toolbar button to add the article to
        a menu by opening a **Menus: New Item** page.
    2.  Click the **Save & New** toolbar button to save the article then
        open up an **Articles: New** page. This option saves time when
        adding multiple articles.

A system message will indicate that the article has been successfully
saved.

#### Errors on attempting to save:

- If you have not completed the required fields, a red error message
  will appear indicating the missing information you must add.
- You will see an error message if the article has an alias that already
  exists. You can overcome this by amending the alias field.

## Quick Tips

- If you are not the Super User or Administrator, take time to
  understand how the website is set up. Just because you have saved an
  article doesn't mean it is visible on the website. If Category Blog
  pages are being used, assigning the correct category will display the
  article. Otherwise an article needs to be assigned to a menu item. You
  can do this in the article or via **Menus** then **Manage**.
- Try to keep article titles short and specific.
- Whilst it can be done, if there are several users adding articles to
  the website avoid creating new categories and tags in articles.
  Spelling errors and differences can easily prevent articles from
  displaying where they were intended. Creating categories and tags in
  their respective list page ensures consistency across the website.
- If there is a need, make use of article notes. They can be very
  helpful, especially where several people add articles.
- Wherever you are in Joomla you can add an article without going to the
  Home Dashboard - use the Joomla Sidebar Menu.
