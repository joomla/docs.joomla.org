How to Delete an Article</span> Joomla!  4.0

## Introduction

This tutorial covers the steps to delete an article in Joomla!

When you delete an article in Joomla you *Trash* it.

Completely deleting an article involves two stages, the first sends it
to Trash where it is possible to restore it. The second stage empties it
from Trash after which the article is removed permanently.

## Considerations

Consider why you want to delete the article:

- Is it no longer needed? If so, deletion is most likely the right
  course of action.
- Is it an article that could be re-used in the future? It can be very
  frustrating to know you had an article that would have been a good
  starting point for another but you deleted it - consider archiving it
  instead.

## Moving the Article to Trash

- Log in to the Administrator Home Dashboard. More on this here:
  [Logging in or out of the Administrator
  Dashboard](https://docs.joomla.org/J4.x:Logging_in_to_Joomla "Special:MyLanguage/J4.x:Logging in to Joomla").
- From the Sidebar Menu navigate to **Content** then **Articles** to
  open the **Articles List**.
- Click the checkbox to select the article you want to delete.

The article *must* be selected to enable the **Actions** button in the
toolbar.

Click the **Actions** button then click **Trash** in the dropdown menu.

data-file-width="1000" data-file-height="125" width="800" height="100"
alt="J4x delete article confirmed-en.png" />

The article has now been deleted and you will see a confirmation
message. Clicking the **Trash** button removed the article from the
**Article List** by changing its status to **Trashed**.

At this stage of the process the article has not been completely
removed. This is a helpful feature in case you deleted the article by
mistake.

## Emptying the Article from Trash

To permanently delete the article it must be removed from Trash. To do
this:

1.  From the Article List Toolbar click the **Filter Options** button.
    This will display a set of filter fields.
2.  Set the **- Select Status -** field to **Trashed**. This will filter
    out all articles except trashed ones.
3.  Click the checkbox to select the article.
4.  Click the **Empty Trash** button.
5.  A message box will appear asking if you are sure you want to delete.
    Click **OK** to confirm and the article will be removed from Trash.
6.  Click the **Clear** button at the side of **Filter Options** and
    this will remove the filter and return to the **Article List**.

## Quick Tips

- Remember, deleting an article is not the same as archiving an article.
  Once it has been emptied from Trash it has gone for good.
- If you delete an article by mistake but have not emptied it from
  Trash, you can change its status. You have the options to set it as
  *Archived*, *Published* or *Unpublished*.
- Joomla will not let you save more than one article with the same
  alias. If an article is deleted but left in Trash, it still exists. If
  you try to save an article and you get an error stating the alias
  already exists, it may be sat in Trash! You should therefore either
  empty it from trash or you can enter a different alias for your new
  article.
- Joomla keeps previous versions of an article unless it is disabled. If
  you are deleting an article because it somehow "broke", try reverting
  it back to save time.
