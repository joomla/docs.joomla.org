- **Site Name:** This is the domain name that will be automatically
  created and used for your Joomla website. For example, if you type in
  “carwash”, then the URL used to access your site will be
  carwash.joomla.com.
- **Email Address:** Your email address is used so that you will have a
  way to log into your website & your Cloud Control Panel.
- **Country:** This data is simply for us to track where the signups
  come from.

Of course, we do require you to agree to our Terms of Service, which you
can fully read right from the sign up page.  
If you agree to sign up for our marketing campaign, this simply gives us
permissions to send you marketings emails, this is not a requirement.

Under our **Advanced Settings** you can choose which of the latest
Joomla! versions you would like to use, and you can also decide if you
want your website to renew monthly, or daily!

It is a simple as that and once your site is up and running, you can
start configuring and extending it right away by adding the extensions
you need. phpMyAdmin and FTP access are also available should you need
them.

to the official Joomla! Website to learn how you can be contribute to
the project and community.
