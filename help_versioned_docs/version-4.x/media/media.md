## Image Display Area

### Local

This area shows the structure of the local folders of your site, by
default the **images** folder. [Quick Tip](#quicktips)

The currently selected folder is also shown in the **Breadcrumbs** above
the image display area.

### Top Bar

- **Checkbox**. Select/Deselect All Images. After selection you can
  deselect individual images.
- **Breadcrumbs**. Select a breadcrumb item to go back in the folder
  hierarchy.
- **Search**. Type some part of an image name in the search box. The
  filter works progressively - for example, entering the letter "k" in
  the search box will instantly reduce the displayed images to those
  containing a letter "k".
- **Magnifier Icons**. Decrease/Increase the visible size of the
  thumbnail images.
- **List View/Thumbnail View Icons**. Toggles between Thumbnail and List
  views - the icon changes accordingly.
- **Information Icon**. Displays information on whatever is selected. If
  an image is selected it will show the file name, folder path, size and
  various other properties. Select to open or close the Information
  panel.

### Actions

Hover over an image and select the menu button labelled with 3 dots. 6
icons appear offering the following actions:

1.  **Preview**. Select the magnifier icon - the image is shown full
    size in a dialog.
2.  **Edit**. Select the pencil icon to open the Media Edit window. It
    allows you to crop, resize or rotate the image.
3.  **Download**. Select the download icon - your computer will respond
    by asking you what you want to do with the download. Or it may just
    save it or open it in an image display application.
4.  **Get a shareable link**. Select the link icon to get a link to the
    image that you can use for sharing. A dialog allows you to copy the
    link to your clipboard for pasting into an email or document.
5.  **Rename**. Select the rename icon to open a dialog that allows you
    to rename the image.
6.  **Delete**. Select the waste bin icon to delete the image. You will
    be prompted to confirm. Once deleted it is gone forever! May be used
    also to delete a folder.

## Toolbar

At the top of the page you will see the toolbar shown in the
[Screenshot](#screenshot) above.

- **Upload**. Opens window for uploading images.
- **Create New Folder**. Opens a dialog to prompt for a new folder name.
  The new folder is created in the currently selected folder.
- **Delete**. Deletes the selected images.
- **Options**. Opens [Media
  Options](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Media:_Options/en "Help4.x:Media: Options/en").
- **Help**. Opens this help screen.

## Quick Tips

- If you wish to keep images and documents in separate local folders:
  1.  create a folder in the root of your site, say **files**
  2.  go to the [Filesystem -
      Local](https://docs.joomla.org/J4.x:Media:_Options/en "J4.x:Media: Options/en")
      plugin and add **files** under **Select directories**.
  3.  Back in the Media component you will see *images* and *files* as
      separate items in the Local panel.
- The Media's maximum upload size can be changed to an amount other than
  "10 MB" in the [Media
  Options](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Media:_Options/en "Help4.x:Media: Options/en").
- You can upload or delete multiple files at the same time.
