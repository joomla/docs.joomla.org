## Details and Message

-   **Mail to Child Groups.** Whether or not to send the Email to members
    of all child groups of the selected group. For example, if this box is
    checked and the "Public" group is selected, the email would be sent to
    all users, since all groups are child groups of "Public".
-   **Send in HTML mode.** Whether or not to send the Email with headers
    that identify it as an HTML document. Email clients that support this
    will render any HTML codes.
-   **Send to Disabled Users.** If checked, disabled users will be
    included when sending mail.
-   **Recipients as BCC.** If checked, all recipients will be included as
    BCC entries, so none will see any of the other recipients' Email
    addresses. Because many mail routers treat Email without a _To:_ entry
    as spam, the site email will be used for the _To:_ entry.
-   **Group.** Select the groups you want to send the Email to.
-   **Subject** Enter the Subject of the Email. Try to make it as
    descriptive as possible. Any text entered in the _Subject Prefix_
    parameter in Options ([User Options → Mass
    Mail](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Users:_Options/en#Mass_Email 'Help4.x:Users: Options/en'))
    will be placed in front of the subject you enter here.
-   **Message.** Enter the body of the Email. Any text entered in the
    _Mailbody Suffix_ parameter in Options ([User Options → Mass
    Mail](https://docs.joomla.org/Help4.x:Users:_Options/en#Mass_Email 'Help4.x:Users: Options/en'))
    will be added to the text you enter here.

## Toolbar

At the top of the page you will see the toolbar shown in the
[Screenshot](#Screenshot) above. The functions are:

<!-- -->

    screen without saving any modifications you may have made.
