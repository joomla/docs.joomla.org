## Column Headers

Click on the title of a column header to sort by that column. The
purpose of each column is as follows:

- **Checkbox.** Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items.
- **Status.** The status of this item (Enabled or Disabled).
- **Update Site.** The URL of the update source site.
- **Name.** The name of the Extension.
- **Location.** Site or Administrator Extension
- **Type.** Package, Component, File...
- **Folder.** ...
- **ID.** This is a unique identification number for this action
  assigned automatically by Joomla. It is used to identify the item
  internally, and you cannot change this number.

## List Filters

**Search bar.** This is a common feature of most Lists. The layout is as
shown below.

- **Search by Text.** Enter part of the search term and click the Search
  icon. The search may be of one or more fields. *Hover* to see a
  *Tooltip* indicating which fields will be searched. In some cases a
  different format is required. For Example, to **Search by ID** enter
  "id:xx", where "xx" is the item ID number (for example, "id:9").
- **Filter Options.** Click to display or hide the additional filters.
- **Clear.** Click to clear the Filter field and restore the list to its
  unfiltered state.
- **Ordering.** Shows the current table ordering field. Select from the
  drop down list to change the order or click a column heading. Ordering
  may be in ascending or descending order. The column heading toggles
  between ascending and descending order.
- **Number to Display.** Shows the number of items in a list. The
  default for a site is 20 but this may be changed in the global
  configuration. Select from the drop-down list to change the number
  displayed. If you select too many complex items they will be slow to
  deliver and display.

**Filter Options**

- ***- Select Status -*** Shows items that are Published and
  Unpublished. Does *not* show items that are Trashed or Archived.
  - ***Trashed:*** Shows only items that are Trashed. **Important
    Note:** To permanently delete items: Change the status of the items
    to Trashed. Change the Status filter to Trashed. At this point the
    trashed items will show and an icon called "Empty trash" will show
    in the toolbar. Select the desired trashed items and click on "Empty
    Trash" in the toolbar. The items will be permanently deleted.
  - ***Unpublished:*** Shows only items that are Unpublished.
  - ***Published:*** Shows only items that are Published.

  access.

has a dark colour background.
