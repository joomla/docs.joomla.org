## Column Headers

In the table containing the user note categories from your Joomla! site,
you will see different columns.

- **Checkbox**. Check this box to select one or more items. To select
  all items, check the box in the column heading. After one or more
  boxes are checked, click a toolbar button to take an action on the
  selected item or items. Many toolbar actions, such as Publish and
  Unpublish, can work with multiple items. Others, such as Edit, only
  work on one item at a time. If multiple items are checked and you
  press Edit, the first item will be opened for editing.

<!-- -->

- **Ordering.** You can change the order of an item within a list as
  follows:
  - If the list Filter Options include a Position filter select the
    desired Position. This will limit the list to items that are
    assigned to that Position.
  - Select the Ordering icon <img

    each row will change from light grey to dark grey and the pointer

***\<Item Type\>** refers to the page name of items.*

You can change one value or all four values at one time.

***Note** - if you copy items to a new category, changes you have
selected from access level and language will be applied to the copies,
not the original.*

**How to Batch Process** a group of items:

1.  Select one or more items on the list by selecting the desired
    checkbox(es).
2.  Set one or more of the following values:
    - To change the **Access Levels**, select the desired new access
      level from the Set Access Level list box.
    - To change the **Language**, select the desired language from the
      Set Language list box.
    - To add a **Tag**, select the desired tag from the Add Tag list
      box.
    - To change the **Category**, select a category. To leave the
      category unchanged, use the default value of "Select".

    1.  To copy the items to a different category, select the desired
        category from the category list box and check the Copy option.
        In this case, the original items are unchanged and the copies
        are assigned to the new category and, if selected, the new
        access level and language.
    2.  To move the items to a different category, select the desired
        category from the category list box and check the Move option.
        In this case, the original items will be moved to a new category
        and, if selected, be assigned the new access level and language.
3.  When all of the settings are entered, click on Process to perform
    the changes. A message **"Batch process completed successfully."**
    will show.

Note that nothing will happen if you (a) don't have any items selected
or (b) have not selected an access level, language, or category.

If you wish to clear your entered selections, click on the Clear button.
This will return all of the Batch controls to their default values. Note
that this does *not* uncheck the check boxes for the items.
